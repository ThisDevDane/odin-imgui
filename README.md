# odin-imgui

This is an odin wrapper for [dear imgui v1.82](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (Generated from the auto-generated [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui.git)).

It contains generated wrappers as well as handwritten ones to make it better fit with the odin language.
It will also contain extra utility functions that are not present in cimgui.

You can download the latest release with pre-built cimgui binaries [here.](https://github.com/ThisDrunkDane/odin-dear_imgui/releases/latest)

## Examples

You can find examples of setting up `odin-imgui` using the provided [implementations](#implementations) inside the `examples` folder, current examples exists;

Done:
 - SDL with OpenGL 4.5

WIP:
 - SDL with D3D11

## Implementations

Implementations are reusable bits of code using popular odin libraries/bidings, inside the `impl` folder there currently are;

 - SDL using [`odin-sdl2`](https://github.com/JoshuaManton/odin-sdl2)
 - OpenGL using [`odin-gl`](https://github.com/vassvik/odin-gl)

## Notes:
* Most functions have been wrapped or bound, those missing will either be added by the maintainer over time or by PR (PRs VERY WELCOME)

## Building cimgui
If you want to build cimgui yourself instead of using the binaries that exist in the repo, you can just call `make cimgui` from a command prompt that has `cl` and `link` in their path.

If you need to build cimgui:
```
In the cimgui makefile change the compiler flags to:
CXXFLAGS=-O2 -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -fno-threadsafe-statics

1. make
2. make static

Rename libcimgui.a to cimgui.a
Move cimgui.a to odin-imgui external.
```
